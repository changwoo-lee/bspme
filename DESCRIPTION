Description: Scalable methods for fitting Bayesian linear and generalized linear models in the presence of spatial exposure measurement error. These models typically arise from a two-stage Bayesian analysis of environmental exposures and health outcomes. From a first-stage model, predictions of the covariate of interest (''exposure'') and their uncertainty information (typically contained in MCMC samples) are used to form a multivariate normal prior distribution for exposure in a second-stage regression model. This package also provides implementation of the methods used in Lee et al. (2024) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00634>.
